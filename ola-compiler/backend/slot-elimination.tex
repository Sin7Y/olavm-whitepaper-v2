\subsubsection{Slot elimination}

This pass handles the stack slot for local variables.

Its pipeline is as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={}]
VistModule
    | VisitFunction layout
        | VisitBasicBlock
            | Match inst's data operand is Slot type
                | workList: push inst 
    | Computer slot offset
    | foreach workList
        | fixup inst's operand with offset and size
\end{lstlisting}
