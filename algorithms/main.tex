Ola uses zero-knowledge proof technologies to ensure the correct execution of the program and protect privacy. Zero-knowledge proof technologies enable one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. 

Two of the most compelling zero-knowledge technologies on the market today are zk-STARK and zk-SNARK. Zk-SNARK stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge. They were introduced in a \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090263}{2012 paper} co-authored by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa, and Eran Tromer. Zk-STARK stands for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge and is a zero-knowledge proof system that was introduced as an alternative to SNARKs in a \href{https://starkware.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/STARK-paper.pdf}{2018 paper} by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horesh, and Michael Riabzev. We have a table depicting some of the high-level differences between the two technologies.
