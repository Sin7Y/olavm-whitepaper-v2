Ola uses ZKP to ensure the correct execution of the program and protect privacy. ZKP enables one party to prove to another party that a statement is true without revealing any private information.

Two of the most compelling zero-knowledge technologies on the market today are ZK-STARK\cite{cryptoeprint:2018/046} and ZK-SNARK\cite{cryptoeprint:2011/443}. We have a table depicting some high-level differences between them.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
                            & ZK-SNARK    & ZK-STARK                   \\
        \hline
        Proving complexity   & $O(N\log(N))$ & $O(N\mathrm{polylog}(N))$            \\
        \hline
        Verifying complexity & $O(1)$        & $O(\mathrm{polylog}(N))$              \\
        \hline
        Proof size           & $O(1)$        & $O(\mathrm{polylog}(N))$              \\
        \hline
        Trusted setup        & YES         & NO                         \\
        \hline
        Quantum resistant    & NO          & YES                        \\
        \hline
        Crypto assumptions   & Strong      & Collision resistant hashes \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent The advantages of ZK-STARK are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lower gas (more scalable)
    \item Larger batch size (more scalable)
    \item Faster proofs (more scalable)
    \item No trusted setup (the generated parameters are only valid for the current application, if there are changes, you need to re-setup)
    \item Post-quantum secure
\end{enumerate}

However, the proof generated by ZK-STARK is larger, and due to some limitations such as WASM, additional operations are required to turn the ZK-STARK proof into a ZK-SNARK proof during construction.
