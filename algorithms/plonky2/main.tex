\subsection{Plonky2} \label{sec:Plonky2}

plonky2 = plonkish contraints system + Deep-Fri commitment + Goldilocks field. We plan to use plonky2 as our recursive Layer2 and Layer3 (supported in the future) because it's more suitable
for specific computation than starky which is more suitable for ZKVM. Should be noted that the designs described in this are the original design of plonky2, which will be more convenient to learn for
the reader.
