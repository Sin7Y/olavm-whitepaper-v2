FRI is a protocol that establishes that a committed polynomial has a bounded degree. The acronym FRI stands for Fast Reed-Solomon IOP of Proximity, where IOP stands for interactive oracle proof. Ola uses Deep-FRI for its polynomial commitment scheme. Readers can read the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12243}{paper} for more details.
