\begin{abstract} 

    \noindent We are building a ZK-ZKVM platform for Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum} that will provide: 
    (1) optional privacy, allowing project parties and users to choose to deploy or send public or private projects or transactions according to their own needs; 
    (2) programmable privacy, not single Scenario privacy protection, supports smart contracts; 
    (3) higher programmability, supports ISA-based smart contract language, allows developers to compile arbitrary logic; 
    (4) faster programmability proof, design a full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM, OlaVM \cite{website:OlaVM} can quickly execute transactions and generate Proof; 
    (5) Develop a friendly smart contract language, customize the smart contract language Ola-lang \cite{website:Ola-lang}, the syntax is close to rust, and it is convenient for traditional developers to learn quickly; 
    (6) Developer-friendly IDE, integrate the Ola lang language into the Vscode platform, Convenient for traditional developers to develop quickly; 
    (7) Better scalability, based on the LLVM compilation framework, it is easier to achieve compatibility with other high-level languages, such as Solidity \cite{website:Solidity}; 
    (8) Regulatory-friendly privacy, by sharing view keys to regulators, to track the actual whereabouts of privacy assets and avoid tornado cash \cite{website:Tornado-cash} The disadvantages of untraceable assets; 
    (9) Updatable view key, which can continuously monitor and track the user account status and behavior after the view key is exposed to a third party; 
    (10) Data ownership, without permission Under the premise, ensure that the user's asset information and on-chain data are in a private state.

    \noindent Ola is a rapidly developing project. 2nd whitepaper will just detail the design philosophy and design specifications of the full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM, OlaVM \cite{website:OlaVM} and dev-friendly 
    smart contract language, Ola lang \cite{website:Ola-lang}. Privacy-related implementation details will be released in 3rd whitepaper when the testnet is released. Update.
