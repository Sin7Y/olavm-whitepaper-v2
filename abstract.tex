\begin{abstract} 
    We are developing a ZK-ZKVM platform for Ethereum\cite{website:Ethereum} that will offer the following features: 
    (1) Programmable privacy: supporting a vast variety of privacy design options for smart contracts. dApp developers can at an application level, develop private and public functions, and users can use these dApps to send both public and private transactions according to their needs;
    (2) Robust architecture: through the means of viewing keys which can be shared to third parties, we create a compliance-friendly landscape. Ola provides the possibillity for any entity to track the actual whereabouts of private assets, avoiding the disadvantages of untraceable assets, such as Tornado Cash \cite{website:Tornado-cash};
    (3) Flexible data sharing: indefinitely exposing your viewing key to a third party allows for continouous monitoring and tracking of an accounts status;
    (4) Data ownership: empowering users by returning the control of their own asset information and on-chain data;
    (5) High programmability: a customized GPL language which has more advanced features and is more programmable than DSL\cite{website:DSL}; 
    (6) High performance: customized full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM, OlaVM\cite{website:OlaVM}, can quickly execute transactions and generate proofs due to, amongst other, its
     non-deterministic computation and succinct instruction set; 
    (7) Better language scalability: based on the LLVM compilation framework, it is easier to achieve compatibility with other advanced programming languages; 
    (8) Developer-friendly language: Ola-lang\cite{website:Ola-lang} is customized for smart contract development with syntax similar to Rust, making it convenient for developers quickly adopt it; 
    (9) Developer-friendly suite of tools: Ola-lang language plug-in is integrated into Visual Studio Code, making it convenient for traditional developers to start building.

    \noindent Ola is a rapidly developing project and this is the second whitepaper which will describe the design philosophy and specifications of our full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM,  
    OlaVM\cite{website:OlaVM} and developer-friendly general purpose smart contract language, Ola-lang\cite{website:Ola-lang} in details. Implementation details related to privacy will be released in the upcoming third whitepaper upon releasing the test net.
