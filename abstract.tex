\begin{abstract} 

    \noindent We are developing a ZK-ZKVM platform for Ethereum\cite{website:Ethereum} that will offer the following features: 
    (1) Programmable privacy: unlike specific privacy, Ola could shield for everything which supports user-defined functions; 
    (2) Optional privacy: both the project side and user side could optionally choose to deploy/send public/private type; 
    (3) Compliance-friendly privacy: through the means of viewing keys that can be shared with third parties, we create a compliance-friendly landscape, providing the possibility for 
    regulators to track the private assets, avoiding the disadvantages of untraceable assets, such as Tornado Cash\cite{website:Tornado-cash}; 
    (4) Upgradeable view key: avoiding third-party continuous monitoring and tracking of an account's status; 
    (5) Data ownership: taking the control of their asset information and on-chain data; 
    (6) High programmability: a customized GPL language which has more advanced features and is more programmable than DSL\cite{website:DSL}; 
    (7) High performance: customized full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM, OlaVM\cite{website:OlaVM}, can quickly execute transactions and generate proofs because of 
    the non-deterministic computation, succinct instruction sets, etc; 
    (8) Better language scalability: based on the LLVM compilation framework, it is easier to achieve compatibility with other advanced programming languages; 
    (9) Developer-friendly language: Ola-lang\cite{website:Ola-lang} is customized for smart contract development with syntax similar to Rust, making it convenient for developers quickly adopt it; 
    (10) Developer-friendly tools: Ola-lang language plug-in is integrated into the Visual Studio Code, making it convenient for traditional developers to start building.

    \noindent Ola is a rapidly developing project and this is the second whitepaper that will describe the design philosophy and specifications of our full-featured zk-friendly ZKVM,  
    OlaVM\cite{website:OlaVM} and developer-friendly general purpose smart contract language, Ola-lang\cite{website:Ola-lang} in details. Implementation details related to privacy will be released in the upcoming third whitepaper upon releasing the test net.
