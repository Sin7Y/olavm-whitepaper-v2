\subsubsection{Account Private Keys}\label{section: account-private-keys}

Account private keys are derived from the associated spending keys. Account private keys are private keys just like the spending keys and can not be leaked to others. A Account private key can be used to sign transactions and generate note commitments. It mainly consists of three parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Random commitment key
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a random number used in commitment scheme
        \end{itemize}
    \item Signature secret key
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A key used in signature scheme
        \end{itemize}
    \item Random seed
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A random number seed
            \item Signature secret key and rcm are all derived from a rseed
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The random commitment key is a scalar used in commitment schemes. The signature secret key is also a scalar used for private keys in signature schemes. The random seed is a random number generated by a random number generator, which is an element in a finite field and is 32 bytes in size.
