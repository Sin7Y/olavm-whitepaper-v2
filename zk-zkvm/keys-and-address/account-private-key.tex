\subsubsection{Account Private Key}\label{section: account-private-key}

The account private key is derived from the associated spending key, and is also a private key like the spending key and can not be leaked to others. An account private key can be used to sign transactions and generate note commitments. It mainly consists of three parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Random commitment key
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A random number used in commitment scheme.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Signature secret key
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A key used in signature scheme.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Random seed
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A random number seed
            \item The signature secret key and the random commitment key are all derived from the random seed.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The random commitment key is a scalar used in commitment schemes. The signature secret key is also a scalar used for the private key in signature schemes. The random seed is a random number generated by a random number generator, which is an element in a finite field and is 32 bytes in size.
