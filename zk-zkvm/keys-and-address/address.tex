\subsubsection{Address}\label{section: address}

An address is generated by the associated account public key or viewing key to receive transfers. Addresses in Ola are either transparent or shielded (private). Transparent addresses are publicly visible on the blockchain, in the same way that Bitcoin addresses are viewable. Shielded addresses are invisible and transactions between shielded addresses do not reveal either address, the transaction value or the content of the encrypted field.

Zcash has defined a mechanism for generating hierarchical deterministic wallets in ZIP 32 \cite{website:ZIP-32}, just like BIP 32 \cite{website:BIP-32}. It can help users who want to generate multiple addresses per account. All derivations produce an opaque binary spending key, from which the keys and addresses are then derived.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ZIP 32
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Account 0
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Diversified address 0
                    \item Diversified address 1
                    \item ...
                \end{itemize}
            \item Account 1
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Diversified address 0
                    \item Diversified address 1
                    \item ...
                \end{itemize}
            \item ...
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Ola will also design a similar mechanism in the future to implement a lightweight diversified address derivation scheme, which provides different payment addresses to different senders when users receive money to better protect the privacy of users.
