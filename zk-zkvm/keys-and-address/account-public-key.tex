\subsubsection{Account Public Key}\label{section: account-public-key}

The account public key is derived from the associated account private key, which mainly consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Signature public key
    \item Signature public random key
    \item PRF secret key
\end{itemize}

The signature public key is a public key derived from a signature secret key and a group generator on an elliptic curve. It is essentially also a group element on the elliptic curve, and is used to verify the signature in a signature scheme.
\[ \mathrm{Sig\_Pub\_Key} = G^{\mathrm{Sig\_Pri\_Key}} \]

The signature public random key is a random number derived from random commitment key for a signature scheme, and is essentially an element of the group defined on the elliptic curve.
\[ \mathrm{Sig\_Pub\_Rand} = G^{\mathrm{rcm}} \]

The PRF secret key is a key used in the Pseudo Random Function to generate pseudo-random numbers.
\[ \mathrm{PRF}_{sk}(x) = \mathrm{Hash}(sk \mathbin{||} x) \]
