\subsubsection{Account Public Keys}\label{section: account-public-keys}

Account public keys are derived from the associated account private keys, which mainly includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Signature public key
    \item Signature public random key
    \item PRF secret key
\end{itemize}

The signature public key is a public key derived from the generator G of the group on an elliptic curve and a signature secret key, which is essentially a group element on the elliptic curve, and is used to verify the signature in a signature scheme
$$Sig\_Pub\_Key = G^{Sig\_Pri\_Key}$$

The signature public random key is a random number derived from random commitment key for a signature scheme, and is essentially an element of the group defined on the elliptic curve
$$Sig\_Pub\_Rand = G^{rcm}$$

The PRF secret key is a key used in the Pseudo Random Function to generate pseudo-random numbers
$$PRF_{sk}(x) = Hash(sk||x)$$
