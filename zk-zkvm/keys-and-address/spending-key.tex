\subsubsection{Spending Keys}\label{section: spending-keys}

Spending keys are the most important keys in the key system. Similar to the private keys in Bitcoin, whoever owns the spending key can spend and view the balance and transaction history in the address associated with this key. The Spending key is used to generate other keys, which is essentially a 256-bit random number, which makes it as secure as Bitcoin in some respects.
