\subsubsection{Spending Key}\label{section: spending-key}

The spending key is the most important key in the key system. Similar to the private key in Bitcoin, whoever owns the spending key can spend and view the balance and transaction history in the address associated with this key. The spending key is essentially a 256-bit random number, which makes it as secure as Bitcoin in some respects, and is used to derive other keys.
