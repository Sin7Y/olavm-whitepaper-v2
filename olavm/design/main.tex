\subsection{Design Principles} \label{sec:design-principles-2}

OlaVM's vision is to build a high-performance, programmable and decentralized Ethernet scaling solution that can help the Ethereum ecosystem to
host more businesses and applications in the future.See \figref{fig:olavm-vision}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item As Layer2, it needs to achieve high performance while taking into account the core features of programmability,composability and
          decentralization, so that existing and future Ethereum applications can be directly deployed on OlaVM;
    \item Higher throughput and lower cost are the demands of these applications
\end{itemize}
