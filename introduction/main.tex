\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid development of the blockchain industry; 
the influx of capital, users and Builders has made the entire blockchain industry reach 
an unprecedented prosperity. However, since blockchain is still a brand new field and the
infrastructure is not yet sound, there are also some problems behind the prosperity. 
The more prominent problem is the low TPs of the blockchain system, especially the public
chain with the largest ecology Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum}, in the peak case \cite{website:Etherscan-chart}, can only process up to 23 
transactions per second, which is far from the traditional centralized system. 

There are many reasons for the congestion of the Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum} network, such as the slow POW \cite{website:POW} 
consensus algorithm(Shanghai upgrade \cite{website:Shanghai-upgrade} to POS \cite{website:POS} consensus), the repeated execution of 
transaction verification by nodes, and the serial execution of transactions; 
for the above reasons, many projects from different dimensions Try to expand Ethereum 
to obtain higher throughput. Attempt 1: New public chain, independent of Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum}, 
using faster consensus algorithm or faster transaction execution, such as BSC \cite{website:BSC}, Solana \cite{website:Solana}, 
Aptos \cite{website:Aptos}, etc..; Attempt 2: Sidechain, as Layer2 network of Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum}, using faster consensus
algorithm and regularly synchronizing to Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum}, such as Polygon \cite{website:Polygon}, Optimism \cite{website:Optimism}, Arbitrum \cite{website:Arbitrum},
etc.; Attempt 3: ZKEVM, also as Layer2 network of Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum}, using ZK technology to 
solve the problem of repeated execution of transactions, such as Polygon Hermez \cite{website:Polygon-Hermez}, 
Zksync \cite{website:Zksync} and so on.

Obviously, scaling is not the only problem Ethereum \cite{website:Ethereum} has to solve. Since the blockchain is 
a public ledger, all transactions that take place on the chain are open and transparent, 
and the asset information of any address is also open and transparent. Excessive 
information transparency leads to (1)MEV problem, miners selectively package 
transactions according to the fee, resulting in low fee transactions can not be 
confirmed, only to increase the fee; (2)high asset address security issues, in the past 
year, assets stolen hacking countless, the total stolen assets of 20 billion; (3)user data 
ownership issues, whether it is the address of the asset information, or the address of 
various transactions, are free to be monitored and used, which is contrary to 
the vision of Web3 \cite{website:Web3} . Therefore, when the scaling problem has a corresponding mature 
solution, privacy will be the next problem to be solved urgently; in the world of 
blockchain, privacy has never been a new topic, it has long been studied by the Zcash \cite{website:Zcash} team 
and support.
